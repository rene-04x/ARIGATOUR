         <p class="scroll">Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.<br>
            <br>
            The five Main Islands in Japan:<br><br>
            <b>Hokkaido</b> - is the second-largest island of Japan and comprises the largest and northernmost prefecture, making up its own region. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaidō from Honshu; the two islands are connected by the undersea railway Seikan Tunnel.<br><br>
            <b>Honshu</b> -  is the largest and most populous island of Japan. It is located south of Hokkaidō across the Tsugaru Strait, north of Shikoku across the Inland Sea, and northeast of Kyūshū across the Kanmon Straits. The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to the south and east. It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.<br><br>
            <b>Shikoku</b> - is the smallest of the four main islands of Japan. It is 300 km or 186.4 mi long and between 50 and 150 km or 31.1 and 93.2 mi at its widest. It has a population of 3.8 million (as of 2015, 3.1%), the least populated out of Japan's four main islands. It is south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. Shikoku's ancient names include Iyo-no-futana-shima (伊予之二名島), Iyo-shima (伊予島), and Futana-shima (二名島), and its current name refers to the four former provinces that make up the island: Awa, Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo.<br><br>
            <b>Kyūshū</b> -  is the third-largest island of Japan's four main islands and the most southerly of the four largest islands (i.e. excluding Okinawa).In the past, it has been known as Kyūkoku (九国, "Nine Countries"), Chinzei (鎮西, "West of the Pacified Area") and Tsukushi-no-shima (筑紫島, "Island of Tsukushi"). The historical regional name Saikaidō (西海道, lit. West Sea Circuit) referred to Kyushu and its surrounding islands. Kyushu has a land area of 36,782 square kilometres (14,202 sq mi) and a population of 14,311,224 in 2018.<br><br>
            <b>Okinawa Island</b> - officially Okinawa Main Island; is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan in the Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main islands of Japan. he island is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi) long, an average 11 kilometres (7 mi) wide,and has an area of 1,206.98 square kilometers (466.02 sq mi). It is roughly 640 kilometres (350 nmi; 400 mi) south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is 500 km (270 nmi; 310 mi) northeast of Taiwan. The total population of Okinawa Island is 1,384,762. The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000 residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island. Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate.<br><br>

        <p class="scroll"><b>Fun Facts About Japan</b><br>
            1. Around 80% of Japan is covered in mountains which makes it a pretty cool place to explore. There is an area in central Honshu that is known as “the roof of Japan” because the area has so many mountains that are over 3,000m high. Most of the mountains in Japan including the Japan Alps were created by the collision of the continental crust of Asia and the Pacific oceanic crust. This movement caused the land mass to uplift, And helped create Japan as we know it today.
            This mountainous terrain is home to over 100 active volcanoes, with some of the most popular being Mount Fuji, Mount Aso and Sakurajima. That number makes up about 10% of all active volcanoes in the world, which is mad! If you are an adrenaline junkie and love wandering up volcanoes then Japan is the country for you.<br><br>
            2. Christmas isn't classed as an official holiday in Japan, as not many of the population are christian. However, it is still celebrated by plenty of people and one of their Christmas traditions is something you might not expect.
            In Japan the tradition is to head to your local KFC to chow down on a 'KFC Christmas dinner'. Hours of queuing are to be expected and a lot of people even order weeks in advance to make sure. In total it's estimated that 3.6 million Japanese people follow this tradition every year.
            This unique tradition came about thanks to Takeshi Okaware who was the manager of the first KFC in Japan. After the store opened in 1970, Takeshi came up with the idea to see a 'party barrel' full of fried chicken at christmas time.<br><br>
            3. Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, and is second only to Hong Kong. The average life expectancy in Japan is 84, which is 5 years longer than that of the U.S. Over 28% of the Japanese population are aged 65 and older, which is the highest proportion in the world. Japan also has over 70,000 people in the country that are over 100 years old. 
            Japan actually has an island that is nicknamed “the island of longevity”. Okinawa is an archipelago made up of 160 islands, located in the east China Sea which is well known for it's high life expectancy. Many people that live on these islands live past 100 years of age, and there is a very low level of disease here too. The people here live very healthy and happy lives, and it is attributed to the concept “ikigai” which translates to “reason for being” and their healthy diet. <br><br>
            4. There is a little island in Japan called Okunoshima, which is well known for being full of cute rabbits for you to cuddle. The island is nicknamed rabbit island and has become a popular tourist attraction over the years. It is estimated that there are as many as 1,000 rabbits wandering around the island, and that they thrived due to there being no natural predators on Okunoshima. You can even buy food to feed the rabbits which is pretty cool.
            The island is located in the inland sea of Japan and originally has a much darker history. Okunoshima was originally used during World War II to test chemical weapons. During this period workers were given minimum protective gear, which led to many people becoming sick due to the exposure of these gases. Today you can learn all about the island's history at the Poison Gas Museum.
            You can only get to Okunoshima by ferry, so make sure to research the ferry times before your trip. The island is roughly 4km in circumference and takes about an hour to wander around by foot. If you are a nature lover, then make sure you head to this spot! <br><br>
            5. Japan is home to the oldest operating business in the world. Kongo Gumi was established in 578 and specialises in the construction of shrines and temples. That means the company was founded only a century after the fall of the Roman Empire! How crazy is that?
            The company operated for more than 1,400 years as an independent business, until 2006 when it became a subsidiary of Takamatsu Kensetsu due to financial difficulties. However, even though Kongo Gumi is no longer an independent business, it still continues to operate today just under a different company. They specialise in construction, repair and maintenance of Buddhist temples, so definitely won't be short of work in this beautiful country.
            Japan actually has 6 of the world's oldest companies, and 1000's of firms that have been around for over 100 years, although Kongo Gumi was the earliest.<br><br>
